Word typer made with Python.

in this python project I created a simple programe to practice you typing speed.
Sentences to type a randomly selected from a text file that contains the sentences for the user to practice.

The color is set to change for when the user types the correct or wrong character. 


Things I would like to update or change.

- Add import random sentences using an AI API.
- Add more features to store typing record, a score system
- fix minor issue with time not updating correctly.
